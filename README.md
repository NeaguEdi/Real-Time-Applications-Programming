# Real-Time Applications Programming - Project

I designed and implemented a real-time application using C Embedded and the FreeRTOS real-time operating system. The project was built on a dsPIC33FJ128MC802 microcontroller, which was chosen for its motor control and digital signal processing capabilities. The work included developing a full source code repository and technical documentation.
